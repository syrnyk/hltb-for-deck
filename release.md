## HLTB for Deck, How Long to Beat integration for the Steam Deck (v1.4.0)

### Localization support
Added the ability to localize the plugin. Currently supported languages are English and Brazilian Portuguese. Reach out to me if you would like this plugin localized in your language. Thanks to vincentvanvega on the SteamDeckHomebrew Discord for the Portuguese translation!

### Customize visbility of plugin per game

On the game's page, click the gear icon and then Show/Hide HLTB Stats to toggle whether or not the plugin is displayed for the current game. This allows you to customize whether you want to see the stats for a game or not. [(Issue #22)](https://github.com/hulkrelax/hltb-for-deck/issues/22).

### Customize which stats are displayed

From the Quick Access Menu HLTB For Deck settings page, toggle each stat individually. Thanks to geenaxion from the Decky Loader Discord for the feature request.

### Other changes
When starting a game, the stats no longer show up while the game is loading [(Issue #10)](https://github.com/hulkrelax/hltb-for-deck/issues/10).
