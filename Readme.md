# HLTB for Deck

## Description

A plugin to show you game lengths according to How Long To Beat.

Built with [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note that HLTB does not have an official public API. This plugin (and this fork in particular) is heavily depending on the API changes discovered and implemented in [HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI repository](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/HowLongToBeat-PythonAPI). Every change done to API by HLTB breaks this plugin workability. Unfortunately, there may and will be delays in restoring the plugin workability.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This fork is not currently available in **Decky Store** because it was not authorized yet by the previous maintainer. Due to this users have to install releases manually. Please refer to the chapter **Manual installation in Decky** below.

## Features

- On an app page, shows four main stats offered by How Long to Beat
- Clicking **View Details** will take you to their site for the game
- Results are cached for two hours (cache can be cleared from QAM page for HLTB for Deck)
